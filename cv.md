### **About me**
I am studying to be a front-end developer in *RS School*. 

For the last five years I have been working in the sales of building materials and equipment. Prior to that, I held a senior position in the construction of residential multi-storey buildings. 

A year ago I started learning C#. *I really liked it* ***and it didn’t even work out badly***, but I couldn’t continue my studies. 

Now I want to return to this case and bring it to the end. Of the directions, I am interested in **front-end development**.
